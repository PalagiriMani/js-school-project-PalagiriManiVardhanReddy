Goal :
Implement a responsive and polished layout for the Aerospace Evolution Timeline.
Use Flexbox and CSS Grid for layout, header styling, typography, a consistent colour scheme,
placeholder markers for events, modal base styles, and responsive breakpoints for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Main changes:
- Added styles.css with responsive design using Flexbox and Grid.
- Updated index.html structure to include markers and support grid layout.
- Added header styling, typography, and colour scheme.
- Created placeholder styles for event markers.
- Added base styles for modal (hidden by default).
- Included breakpoints for <768px (mobile), 768–1023px (tablet), and ≥1024px (desktop).

How to test:
1. Open index.html in a browser.
2. Verify that the layout adjusts correctly for mobile, tablet, and desktop widths.
3. Check that markers are visible for each timeline event.
4. Confirm modal is hidden by default.
